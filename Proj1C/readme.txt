Our code meets all the criteria described in the spec. 

In addition, our website has the following features: 

- Actor names are formatted in "lastname, first name"
- Lists of actors are ordered by their last name
- Lists of movies are ordered by their title
- After successfully adding a movie or actor, 
	a confirmation message appears below, with 
	information of the new added tuple.
